# Role-based access control

Permissions are defined once in [`lib/rbac.ts`](../lib/rbac.ts) and enforced on
the server by `requirePermission` ([`backend/src/middleware/rbac.ts`](../backend/src/middleware/rbac.ts)).
The UI (`components/app/RequirePermission.tsx`) uses the same definitions only to
hide or disable controls. **The UI is not a security boundary**: every privileged
route re-checks the caller's role, so a bypassed UI still gets `401`/`403`.

## Roles

| Role         | Who                                   | How it is established                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `user`       | Any wallet with a valid session       | Server-validated wallet session (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`)            |
| `maintainer` | Wallets on the admin allowlist        | Same session, wallet listed in `ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESSES` (case-insensitive)   |
| `service`    | Indexer / reconciler (machine actors) | `X-Internal-Secret` header, compared in constant time                        |

A forged or expired token yields no principal (`401`). A valid principal without
the required permission gets `403`. Roles are not interchangeable: a maintainer
session cannot call `/internal/*` and the service secret cannot call `/admin/*`.

## Capability matrix

| Permission                          | user | maintainer | service | Guarded routes                                              |

| `internal.reconciliation.execute`   |      |            |   ✅    | `POST /internal/reconciliation/proposals/:id/execute`       |

Maintainers are a strict superset of users.

## Adding a privileged action

1. Add the permission to `PERMISSIONS` and grant it in `ROLE_PERMISSIONS` (`lib/rbac.ts`).
2. Guard the route with `requirePermission("<permission>", [resolvers])`.
3. Add the route to the matrix in `backend/tests/rbac.spec.ts` (missing credentials → 401,
   wrong role → 403, correct role → allowed).
4. Update the table above.

## Known gaps

Routes that are scoped by a `wallet` query parameter without a session
(`/actions`, `/saved-pools`, `/dashboard/*`, `DELETE /actions`) predate this
change and are still unauthenticated; moving them onto `own.data.*` guards is a
follow-up because it changes the client contract.

## Configuration

`ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESSES` (comma-separated) is the maintainer allowlist. No
migration is required.

## Permission Diff Preview (#863)

Before applying role, policy, or access updates, maintainers must preview the computed permission diff (`computePermissionDiff` in [`lib/permission-diff.ts`](../lib/permission-diff.ts)).

The preview:
- Identifies added, removed, and unchanged permissions per role.
- Lists affected actions and user-facing capabilities.
- Requires explicit confirmation (`requiresConfirmation: true`) for broad changes (e.g. granting critical admin permissions to user roles, high-volume role modifications, or revoking core user permissions).
- Protects against unauthorized actors (`PermissionDiffDeniedError`) and stale policy inputs (`StalePolicyInputError`).
