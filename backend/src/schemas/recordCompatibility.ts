/**
 * #822 — EduVault & VaultQuest: compatibility layer for versioned API and record schemas.
 *
 * EduVault and VaultQuest persist domain records (student-owned Web3 storage,
 * learning marketplace flows, vault accounting, prize draws, wallet flows) that
 * were written by several generations of clients. This module is the single place
 * that knows how those generations relate:
 *
 * - **Version metadata.** Every record carries a `schemaVersion`. Records
 *   written before versioning existed have no metadata; they are treated as
 *   the `0.9.0` baseline (see {@link DEFAULT_LEGACY_SCHEMA_VERSION}).
 * - **Read path.** {@link readVaultRecord} accepts any *supported* stored
 *   record and returns the current shape, applying the documented transform
 *   for its version. Old records stay readable after schema changes.
 * - **Write path.** {@link writeVaultRecord} accepts input from any supported
 *   client generation, drops deprecated fields, and stamps the latest version
 *   before the record is persisted. New storage only ever contains the latest
 *   shape.
 * - **API negotiation.** {@link negotiateSchemaVersion} lets a caller ask which
 *   schema version it may speak. Responses are always the latest shape
 *   (additive-only evolution — clients must ignore unknown fields); the check
 *   only rejects versions this build does not understand at all.
 *
 * Errors are typed so HTTP/routes and background jobs can map them without
 * string matching:
 * - {@link UnsupportedSchemaVersionError} — version outside the supported
 *   window (rollout guard; never silently coerced).
 * - {@link RecordCompatibilityError} — record is a supported version but does
 *   not validate against that version's schema (e.g. a required field is
 *   missing).
 *
 * Deprecation policy: a field is deprecated for at least one minor release
 * before removal. While deprecated it is still *accepted* on the write path and
 * dropped with a warning, and it never appears on the current shape returned by
 * the read path. See `backend/docs/SCHEMA_VERSIONS.md`.
